# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Responsive web design is basically the concept of designing a page to be optimally viewed on different mediums, including different resolutions, browsers, and devices. I like it and think it's a great practice because it just makes things more readable and dynamic.

* Tablets and smartphones have just made web design more adaptive. I think this is a good thing, not necessarily for what already has been done, but just to make designers aware of the constantly shifting nature of the Internet. Before mobile browsers became so prolific designers probably didn't have to think about browser size and similar things too much, but now they not only have to think about that, but they know to consider what changes future technologies will bring about that causes them to redesign their sites.
 
* Given that I am not visually impaired, I don't know how they used the web, but I see no reason that visually impaired people shouldn't be able to use the Internet given that it is such a big part of our lives now. Designing websites that you can interact with audibly instead of visually seems to make sense, as well as possibly touch sensors or something similar in the future similar to how tablets and phones work.

* I guess just remembering to consider all the different media that a site can be viewed in is something that resonated with me. I actually went back and checked some of my favorite websites to see if they were dynamic. For some of them, when I reduced the width of the page significantly, they changed to look like how I would see the page on my phone. I had always assumed that the page was just a mobile version, but now I realize that having a "mobile" vs "browser" version is outdated. I wouldn't say anything was "stupid" about what I read, I just hope that people have embraced the mindset of adapting to new technologies instead of just assuming that this is the only big change that is yet to come. As we've seen the last few years, a new technology could come along any day that makes everything else obsolete, and designers will once again have to adapt to that.

* I enjoyed an article linked in the required reading, located here: http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design. This article is from 2010 but still seems very relevant.
