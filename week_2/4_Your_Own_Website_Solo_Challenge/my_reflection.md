# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://amolborcar.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I learned how many things there are to consider when designing a website. I often make decisions about what sites I will visit about a particular topic based on how user-friendly they are, usually without really thinking about it. Personally, I think it about things like how visually pleasing the site is, how easy it is to navigate, and how much I really like being on the site overall. I saw that those things are important in UX design, whereas previously I didn't really know how to quantify it. And I know that it's important because personally, even one bad experience might turn me off to a site forever.

* Honestly, I don't like design and UX. I think it's a useful concept to understand and very important in building a website, and all organizations/companies should pay attention to UX, but I honestly hate design and know that this is not something I would be well suited to. I wouldn't say it was "fun" working on my site but it wasn't painful, but I also didn't have as much time to it this week as I would most weeks.
* 
* My process was basically to plan a vision in my mind and then wireframe it. I looked at other personal websites for inspiration and Googled things like "good personal site design" for ideas. Overall, though, I prefer a simpler style than what most of the results I got had. Some of the ideas I have require Javascript to implement, so I haven't worried about those yet. I also am not married to the idea that I started out with, so though it hasn't changed much yet, I'm definitely willing to change it in the future.
* 
* I would like to understand what content will be on my site before deciding how to modify it next.
* 
* I don't think it was difficult to apply what I learned. And honestly I didn't find anything super cool, but like I said design is not really my cup of tea.
* 
* As I mentioned I googled a ton looking for inspiration. A lot of the previous research I had done about HTML/CSS elements for other exercises was useful, and I was glad to see I had retained most of that knowledge.
