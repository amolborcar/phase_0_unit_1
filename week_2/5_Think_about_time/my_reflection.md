# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

* My biggest time management challenge is not so much managing my time but being motivated to complete all the Phase 0 tasks in a timely fashion.  I recently left my job, so I have a lot of free time.  However, this is the first time in a long time that I have this kind of free time, and it's likely that I won't have this kind of time available again for a while, so motivating myself to choose work over play, even if this is work I enjoy doing, will be the biggest challenge.

* So far I've been trying to do my work as part of my leisure time.  For example, I've been doing some of the exercises while relaxing in the park during the day.  Since most of my friends are still working during the day, I have been spending a lot of this time by myself, so I can take my laptop or reading material with me wherever I go. My plan is to continue doing things like this, so I will find a couple hours every day to relax on the beach or outdoors somewhere and do an exercise or two here or there while still enjoying my free time.

* I do plan on starting meditation, I think it can only help relax my mind and hopefully help me focus on the tasks at hand when I'm working on them.  I downloaded an app that was mentioned in one of the articles and will try that out.  I also will try to designate periods as "work periods" and use those times to be more productive to see if I can focus better during those times.  The Pomodoro Technique, which was described in the reading, seems useful in that regard.  I've never tried something like this before, since at my previous jobs and in school there were always distractions and things like meetings that came up so I couldn't commit a chunk of time to one task.  However, now those distractions are gone so I should be able to try this method out.

* My overall plan is to fit Phase 0 work into my everyday life and find times when I can really commit myself to the work while still enjoying my time off, so that it doesn't feel as much like "work."  I'm planning on using this time to both develop personally and work on relaxing my mind more (yoga, meditation) while still developing professionally, not just through Phase 0, but also through independent research and attending things like Meetups and talking to friends and acquaintances in the industry.
