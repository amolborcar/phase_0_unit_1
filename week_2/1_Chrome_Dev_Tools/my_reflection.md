# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
 

* The Document Object Model is a way to represent and interact with different objects in HTML and CSS.  The DOM is cross-platform and cross-language.  I think it makes sense to view a page as a tree and the different objects as different branches of that tree.  I think it's good because it is a unified way to view and construct web pages, I suppose it could be a problem if pages become more evolved and dynamic so that the DOM cannot handle it. 
* The wordpress.com sites are generally just much more complicated and include some Javascript, but I can see the bare bones being similar between the sites and can generally identify objects accurately in a Wordpress site.
* I found Chrome Web Tools kind of a pain.  I like the concept of it and I think it is very useful and has a wide array of useful features, but I found navigation between stylesheets and javascript elements to be a little clunky.  This was especially true in the CodeSchool course, where I think other elements of the CodeSchool website were popping up (but I'm not sure).  I can see myself using Web Tools often but hopefully I will have a better experience once I'm more familiar with Javascript and web development.
* No real "aha" moments since I looked at this in week 1.
* I thought the CodeSchool course was very helpful but it seemed a little rushed, and I think it would have been better to have some javascript review before looking at CodeSchool.  I read a few Wikipedia articles on the DOM and its origins too.
