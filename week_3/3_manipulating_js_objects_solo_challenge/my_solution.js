// Write your code below.

// Define variable adam

var adam = {

// Give adam a name property of "Adam"
adam.name = "Adam"

// Give tera a spouse property of adam

terah.spouse = adam

// Change the weight property of terah

terah.weight = 125

// Remove the eye color property of terah

delete terah.eyeColor

// Give adam a spouse property of terah

adam.spouse = terah

// Give terah a children property

terah.children = {}

// add carson property

terah.children.carson = {
  name: "Carson"
}

// add carter property

terah.children.carter = {
  name: "Carter"

// add colton property

terah.children.colton = {
  name: "Colton"

// add children to adam

// I felt this was a good refresher for myself on working with objects and properties in JavaScript.  
// I had seen all this material before but not in a long time, so it took me a few tries to get the syntax correct.
// I didn't have any real problems, but I did do a bit of Googling to see if there was a "literal notation"
// that could be used to add or modify an object's properties.  I didn't find anything but I felt that exercise helped with my understanding of objects.
// I feel fairly confident in doing basic manipulations of object variables and think I could repeat similar exercises that I did in this task without any difficulty.
