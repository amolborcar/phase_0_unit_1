			<h4> Pairing </h4>
			<ul>
				<li><em> What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges? </em></li><br/>
					<p> 
						I thought it was interesting pairing to solve challenges, and usually more difficult than I would have thought.  I actually thought all my paired challenges went really well and I had good chemistry with my pairs each time, but I just figuring out roles and being on the same page was more challenging than I thought it would be.
					</p><br/>
				<li><em> Was something particularly fun or rewarding? </em></li><br/>
					<p> 
						Not necessarily fun, but I was interested to see what other people were very good at or had a strong knowledge of relative to me, and conversely what they didn't have as good of a grasp of as I did.  For example, I felt comfortable with creating and manipulating objects in JavaScript, while other people seemed to have a better grasp of CSS and creating functions.
					</p><br/>
				<li><em> Was something frustrating and difficult for you? </em></li><br/>
					<p> 
						Honestly, no, there wasn't anything really frustrating.  Other than issues with Google Hangouts or Stypi or bad Internet connections, I enjoyed all my pairing sessions.
					</p><br/>
			</ul>
			<h4> Feedback </h4>
			<ul>
				<li><em> How did you feel when you read your feedback? </em></li>
				<li><em> Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning? </em></li>
				<li><em> Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair? </em></li><br/>
					<p>
						Apparently none of my feedback has been rated by other students yet, so I can't really answer these questions.
					</p><br/>
				<li><em> How was it to write feedback? </em></li><br/>
					<p>
						Writing feedback, like pairing, was more difficult than I thought.  After a good session I had to wrack my brain to find critiques or things my pair could improve on, and at the same time I didn't want to sound too harsh in articulating those things.  I was trying to be specific but it is difficult to be specific without giving away who I am or which session I'm talking about.  
					</p><br/>
				<li><em> What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair? </em></li><br/>
					<p>
						Again, the hardest thing was articulating my thoughts without sounding unkind or wording it in an unspecific way that isn't particularly helpful to anyone.  Also, for example if I suggested something, trying to describe how much of an issue I thought the behavior was (a big issue or a minor issue) was pretty difficult to articulate.
