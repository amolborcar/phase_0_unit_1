// Reflection

/*

This experience was interesting, once we figured out how to complete the task it wasn't too difficult.
I was person #1, so it was difficult trying to be clear in my instructions in the user stories without
using too technical language or making my descriptions too pseudocode-y.  
I would have liked to do the code more and see how difficult it is to translate a user story to code or pseudocode.
I think this task was to emulate a group experience that involves one person at a higher level explaining what he/she wants,
then the rest of the team trying to create it to that specification.  In that case, I would have preferred being one of the people
actually trying to interpret the instructions, as I feel that is what I'm more likely to experience early in my career.  However,
I did find this point of view interesting. 
Our group was not successful, however that is because we did not RETURN the values calculated by the functions, we only had them
logged to the console.  The functions calculated everything correctly.  I assume the lack of a return command was lost in translation somewhere.
Overall, I thought this was a good experience.  User stories are more difficult than I thought.  When I first started writing I thought I would have my
part done in like 5 minutes but it took a good bit longer than that.
