All of these tests will be run on two sets of numbers.  
One set has an odd number of members, while the other has an even number of members.  
All of these tests should contain one function that runs correctly for both sets of numbers. 

In the first test, I want to create a function called sum.
The sum function should find the sum of all the members in each set of numbers. This can be done
by creating a "total" value and adding each member of the set individually to that "total" until all
members are included in the total. 

In the next test, I want to create a function called mean.
The mean function should return the average value of all elements in each set of numbers. 
The mean function should begin by emulating the sum function to find the total value of all the members
of the set of numbers, and then dividing that total by the number of members in that set of numbers.
The average value can be a decimal value. 

In the final test, I want to create a function called median.
The median function should return the median value of all elements in each set of numbers.
This can be done by first ordering the numbers in the set in ascending value.  
	In the odd set of numbers, the median value will be equal to the middle member of the set once the numbers are ordered.
This can be found by finding the number of members in the set, and then choosing the value of the correct member of the set. 
	In the even set of numbers, the median value will be between two of the values in the set of numbers.
This can be found by taking the average of the two middle numbers of the set. 
The median value can be a decimal value.
