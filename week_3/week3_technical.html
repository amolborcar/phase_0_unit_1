			<h2> Why is JavaScript so Popular? </h2>
			<h3> April 17, 2014 </h3>
				<p> 
					Why is JavaScript so popular?  I'm not sure yet, but it autofilled in my Google search results so I assume it's a question a lot of people have asked. 
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					JavaScript was originally created by Netscape as a competitor to Microsoft's Visual Basic, as a more lightweight version of Sun Microsystems' Java (hence the name).  JavaScript became used more widely when Netscape introduced the Netscape Navigator browser, and more so when Microsoft released Internet Explorer 3.0.
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					To start off, JavaScript is widely considered to be "the language of the web."  It is compatible with all modern browsers and is very compatible with HTML5 elements.  JavaScript elements also do not require a lot of memory to run, unlike older Flash applications, and are usually lightweight and quick to load.  Newer extensions of the original JavaScript language such as AJAX and Node have been developed to remove some of the original limitations of JavaScript, so now JavaScript can handle all kinds of requests.
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					Many people also tout the ease-of-use of JavaScript compared to other languages.  It is very easy to learn and small elements can be added to a website or application quickly if so desired.  In addition, there are a lot of resources and libraries of JavaScript code available for free online since it is so widely used.  There are a lot of tools that either use JavaScript or make JavaScript easier to use, and new things like Chrome Dev Tools have only expanded the use of JavaScript.  JavaScript is also almost entirely object based, which makes learning and implementing it easier.
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					I've seen in a few places that JavaScript's original strengths, it's fast speed and flexibility, are difficult to maintain when everything is run on JavaScript.  Instead of some small piece of a site being built on JavaScript, it is now the backbone for entire sites, and it turns out that doesn't end up being that much faster.  That's why a lot of sites are still using things like Adobe Flash.  However, innovations like Node.js, which enables server-side communication, and the continued growth of online libraries and sites like GitHub will likely cause JavaScript to only become more popular in the future.
